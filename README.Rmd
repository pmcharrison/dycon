`dycon` is an R package that implements three dyadic models of consonance:

- Hutchinson & Knopoff (1978)
- Sethares (1993)
- Vassilakis (2001)

## Installation

You can install the current version of `dycon` from Github as follows:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pmcharrison/dycon")
```

## Usage

By default, input sonorities are interpreted as vectors of MIDI note numbers.
These notes are expanded into their implied harmonics using the `hrep` package
(see `?hrep::sparse_fr_spectrum`).

```{r}
library(dycon)

# Major triad
roughness_hutch(c(60, 64, 67)) 

# Minor triad
roughness_hutch(c(60, 63, 67)) 

# Diminished triad
roughness_hutch(c(60, 63, 66)) 

# Sethares, major triad minus minor triad
roughness_seth(c(60, 64, 67)) - 
  roughness_seth(c(60, 63, 67))

# Vassilakis, major triad minus minor triad
roughness_vass(c(60, 64, 67)) - 
  roughness_vass(c(60, 63, 67))
```

Alternatively, it is possible to provide a custom input frequency spectrum
as a list of two numeric vectors: frequency and amplitude.

```{r}
freq <- c(440, 480, 520)
amp <- c(1, 1, 2)
roughness_hutch(list(freq, amp))
```

These representation formats can be formalised using classes from the `hrep` package,
in particular those created by `hrep::pi_chord()` and `hrep::sparse_fr_spectrum()`.
